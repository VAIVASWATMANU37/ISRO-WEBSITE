            <h3>2JZ-GTE</h3>
            <p>The Toyota 2JZ-GTE is one of the most revered engines in the world of performance and tuning. Born 
                in 1991, this 3.0-liter inline-six powerhouse came armed with twin sequential turbochargers and a 
                bulletproof cast-iron block. With a robust DOHC 24-valve setup, electronic fuel injection, and forged 
                internals, it was built to take punishment. Officially, it produced 276 horsepower—an agreement among 
                Japanese manufacturers at the time—but in reality, it often exceeded that number, even from the factory.
                What made it truly exceptional was its virtually unlimited potential. With just minor upgrades, many tuners have pushed 
                the 2JZ-GTE beyond 1,000 horsepower without touching the internal components. It became a sensation in drag racing, drifting, and time attack builds around the globe. The Yamaha-designed cylinder head played a crucial role in its high-revving nature and efficiency, making it a favorite for precision builds.
                Its mainstream stardom was sealed when it powered the Toyota Supra Mk4 (A80), with Paul Walker’s orange Supra immortalizing it in The Fast and the Furious films. That cultural moment turned the 2JZ-GTE into a symbol of JDM prowess, and its aura hasn’t faded since.
                Also found in the Toyota Aristo, this engine’s legacy lives on not only in enthusiast garages and 
                motorsport arenas but in the hearts of gearheads who see it as the ultimate expression of 
                performance, durability, and mechanical elegance. It’s not just an engine; it’s an icon of an era 
                when engineering ruled and turbocharged dreams were born in six-cylinder symphonies.
